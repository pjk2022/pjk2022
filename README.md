- 👋 Hi, I’m Paula (@pjk2022)
- 👀 I’m interested in whatever the devs are doing back there... I NEED to know.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html & css with Mimo and The Odin Project. Scared of the .js section...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. Just learning the secrets of the trade.
- 📫 How to reach me: pkaledzi@aol.com
